        "Gold mutual funds": "Another alternative to investing in physical gold is gold mutual funds. They invest directly or indirectly in mutual funds. Direct investment is in gold bullion, while indirect investment is in stocks of gold mining companies or gold ETFs.",

Missing payments, using too much of your available credit, taking on too many loans at once, or frequently applying for new credit can all hurt your score. Even having a short credit history can play a role.",

Some lenders might also offer loans based on your income and ability to repay rather than your credit history.",
        "How to improve my CIBIL score?": "Improving your CIBIL score isn’t an overnight task, but it’s doable. Start by making all your payments on time, keeping your credit card balances low, and avoiding new debt. Checking your credit report regularly for errors can also help.",

        "Can I check my credit score using my Aadhaar card?": "No, Aadhaar alone doesn’t let you check your credit score.

You can use a personal loan foreclosure calculator to calculate the amount you will have to pay. The calculator considers factors such as loan amount, outstanding balance, and foreclosure charges to calculate the amount you will need to pay.",
        "Can I foreclose my personal loan anytime?": "There may be a minimum loan period before foreclosure of your personal loan is allowed. Since the period will depend on your lender, it is best to check with your lender for more details.",
        "What is the difference between foreclosure and prepayment/partial payment?": "Foreclosure of a personal loan means paying off the total balance due on a loan in one go.

        "How do my employment history and experience play a role in determining the rate of interest?": "Your income is stable and regular if you work with a reputed and recognised organisation.

The choice depends on your financial needs and repayment capacity.",
        "What is the interest rate on a personal loan?": "Interest rates for personal loans can differ widely depending on the lender, your credit score, and the current market trends.

        "Equity shares": "Shares are units of a company that represent equity ownership. People who own shares of a company are called shareholders. A retail investor can purchase the shares of a company in the primary market when the company first issued shares through an initial public offering (IPO). Alternatively, they can buy them in the secondary market when the shares are listed on the stock exchange. Shareholders gain through capital appreciation in the shares or through dividends (if any).",
        "Futures and Options": "Futures and options are derivative contracts. This means they derive their value from the underlying asset. The return from these contracts is dependent on the underlying security. Unlike equity shares, futures and options do not give direct ownership to the investor. They are just contracts that the investor enters to buy or sell on a future date at a predetermined price.",
        "Equity Mutual Funds": "Equity mutual funds pool money from investors and invest them in shares of different companies. They are professionally managed, offer in-built diversification, and are less expensive than direct equity investment (shares). Mutual funds are categorised as equity funds if they invest more than 65% in equity. Their performance is market-linked but is considerably less risky than direct equity investment.",
        "Mutual Funds with Equity Exposure": "Mutual funds that have equity exposure but not as much as equity funds can be categorised under this head. Typically, hybrid funds fall under this category. Hybrid funds with high equity exposure can also be considered equity investments. These funds typically have exposure to multiple asset classes such as equity, debt, and cash. Hence their return and risk are not as high as equity mutual funds.",

As you repay the loan, the bank will release the lien on the securities, which means you can sell them as and when you want.

Moreover, you will not be able to sell your mutual funds in case of underperformance, as the bank will hold a lien on it.",
        "Will I continue to receive dividends if I take a loan against mutual funds?": "You will continue to earn profits and receive dividends against your mutual funds even if you take a loan on them.

A person can have insufficient credit if they have add-on credit cards only.",

        "What is fundamental analysis?": "Fundamental analysis is a method used to determine the fair or intrinsic value of a company. It relies on the company’s fundamentals, such as revenue growth, profit growth, accounting ratios, management’s competency and business model to determine the value of its share. Apart from this, the analysis also takes into account the state of the economy and the strength of the industry to determine a company’s fair value.",
        "What is technical analysis?": "Technical analysis is another school of thought that analyses a stock based on its historical price. It uses statistical analysis to evaluate a company based on its stock price, trading volume, and returns. Through this analysis, technical analysts forecast the future price and movement of the stock. The major assumption behind technical analysis is that all the fundamentals are already factored into the stock price, and they remain unchanged.",
        "Why fundamental analysis and technical analysis is required?": "Through fundamental analysis, you can understand the company’s financial health, its business model, and the management’s competency. With technical analysis, you can understand the short-term price movements and determine the entry and exit points for a stock. It also helps analyze the market trends, understand investor psychology, and also detect early signs of a trend reversal.",
        "Which analysis to use – fundamental or technical analysis?": "Both fundamental and technical analysis are important when investing in the stock market. However, they are used for different purposes. Fundamental analysis is used for long-term investing, whereas technical analysis is used for short-term investing.",
        "Is technical analysis enough for trading?": "Although the technical analysis doesn’t guarantee profits, it is a thorough study of all indicators. Traders have used it for several decades in the past to trade in the stock market.",
        "What are the different types of fundamental analysis?": "There are two types of fundamental analysis you need to do to find the intrinsic value of a stock. First is quantitative analysis, and send is qualitative analysis.",
        "What is an efficient market hypothesis?": "The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that the share price reflects all the information, and generating consistent returns is impossible. In other words, the stock trades at fair value on the exchange, which makes it impossible for investors to buy undervalued shares or sell them at inflated prices. Hence it becomes impossible to generate above-market returns, and the only way to generate excess returns is through investing in risky investments."

Even if you live with your parents, as long as you can provide proof of rental transactions, such as financial transaction records, a rental agreement, and rent receipts, you can be eligible for the HRA exemption. However, keep in mind that if you own the property or if your spouse owns it, you won’t be able to take advantage of this benefit. The property must be owned by someone other than yourself or your spouse to qualify for the HRA exemption.",
        "2. Home Ownership in a Different City": "Owning a house in a different city from where you live and work doesn’t mean you can’t claim the HRA. In fact, you can still submit an HRA claim and even deduct the cost of your home loan EMIs from your taxes. This falls under the HRA exemption rule stated inSection 10(13A) of the Income-tax Act. All you need to do is provide sufficient evidence to support your claim. So, whether your home is in a different city or not, you can still enjoy the benefits of the HRA exemption.",
        "3. Rent Sharing with Your Spouse": "When you and your spouse divide the expenses of renting a home, there’s a way to maximize the HRA deduction. Only one of you can claim the entire amount as an HRA deduction, so it’s important to decide who will make the claim. However, if both of you can obtain individual rent invoices for the rental payments, each of you can claim the HRA exemption individually. Just make sure there are no duplicate claims to comply with tax regulations. By effectively managing your rent-sharing arrangement and obtaining individual rent invoices, both you and your spouse can benefit from the HRA exemption.",
        "4. No HRA from Employers": "While employers are typically responsible for providing the HRA benefit, there are situations where they may not include it in your salary structure. But don’t worry, you can still claim the HRA even if your employer doesn’t pay it. UnderSection 80GG of the Income Tax Act, you have the option to claim the benefit if you are paying rent, despite your employer not providing HRA. To complete the process, you will need to submit Form 10BA. So, even if your employer doesn’t pay HRA, you can still enjoy the benefits by meeting the requirements outlined in the Income Tax Act.",

Rent Receipt Requirement": "To claim a portion of your House Rent Allowance (HRA) as a tax deduction under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act, it is important to ensure that your name is mentioned on the rent receipt. This serves as proof that you are the one making rental payments for the house you reside in.",
        "2. HRA Component on Pay Slip": "Another essential requirement is that yourpayslipshould clearly show the House Rent Allowance (HRA) as a distinct component. This allows the income tax authorities to identify the specific portion of your salary designated for house rent.",

        "4. Residing in a Rented Home": "Lastly, you must be living in a rented home to be eligible for an HRA tax deduction. If you are a homeowner or residing in a house for which you do not pay rent, you cannot claim HRA as a tax deduction under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act.",
        "1. How does HRA become tax-exempt?": "Subject to certain conditions, a fixed portion of HRA is exempt from taxes according to theIncome Tax Act of 1961. This exemption is regulated by Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act.",

        "3. Can I save on taxes if I don’t receive HRA?": "Certainly! Even if HRA is not included in your salary or if you are self-employed, you can still save on taxes if you live in a rented house. According to Section 80GG of the Income Tax Act, you can claim a tax deduction based on the lowest value among the following: 25% of your gross annual income, actual rent paid minus 10% of your total income, or Rs. 60,000 annually or Rs. 5,000 per month.",

        "6. Can we claim both HRA and home loan?": "Yes, it is possible to claim both HRA and home loan benefits at the same time. For instance, if you live in a rented house in one city while owning a house (for which you are repaying a home loan) in another city.",
        "7. Is a rent receipt mandatory for HRA exemption?": "If the House Rent Allowance (HRA) you receive is within the limit of Rs. 3,000 per month, you can claim the HRA exemption without the need for providing rent receipts.

Frequent hard enquiries can reduce your credit score by a lot. So, it is best to wait for a certain period before applying for credit cards after rejection.",
        "How long should I wait after being rejected for a credit card?": "It is best to wait for six months to a year before applying for a credit card after rejection. This is because when banks make a hard enquiry of your credit score, your credit score will fall. Banks do an enquiry every time you apply for a credit card.

Taking a six-month or a year gap can also help you rectify the error for which the credit card is rejected and improve your credit score."

        "7. Is a rent receipt mandatory for HRA exemption?": "If the House Rent Allowance (HRA) you receive is within the limit of Rs. 3,000 per month, you can claim the HRA exemption without the need for providing rent receipts.

A retail investor can purchase the shares of a company in the primary market when the company first issued shares through an initial public offering (IPO). Alternatively, they can buy them in the secondary market when the shares are listed on the stock exchange. Shareholders gain through capital appreciation in the shares or through dividends (if any).",
        "Futures and Options": "Futures and options are derivative contracts. This means they derive their value from the underlying asset. The return from these contracts is dependent on the underlying security. Unlike equity shares, futures and options do not give direct ownership to the investor. They are just contracts that the investor enters to buy or sell on a future date at a predetermined price.",
        "Equity Mutual Funds": "Equity mutual funds pool money from investors and invest them in shares of different companies. They are professionally managed, offer in-built diversification, and are less expensive than direct equity investment (shares).

        "Business related risks": "Shares of a company tend to do well in a stock market when the company consistently makes good profits.

A business is exposed to multiple risks such as competition, political and economic conditions, foreign currency risks, and operational risks. All of these impact the share price of the company.

The best part about taking a loan against mutual funds is that you will continue to receive returns and dividends from it. However, you won’t be able to sell to pledged units till you repay back the entire loan.",
        "How does a loan against a mutual fund work?": "Taking a loan against mutual funds is similar to taking a personal or credit card loan but much simpler. The processing time and interest rates for this loan are comparatively lower. Even though you take a loan against your mutual funds, you can continue to invest and earn interest and dividends from them. However, you won’t be able to sell them till you repay the loan. As you repay the loan, the bank will release the lien on the securities, which means you can sell them as and when you want. When you take a loan against mutual funds, the banks hold the right to sell them in case of default. This means that when you can’t pay your interest and principal, the bank will sell them to complete your loan.",

Since you will be invested in the scheme or security, it will grow in value, and you will be able to accumulate wealth for your financial goals.",
        "What is the negative impact of taking a loan?": "Taking a loan against mutual funds has several disadvantages. The banks will give only up to 50% of the value for equity funds and 80% for debt funds. You won’t get loans on all securities; banks have a list of eligible securities and schemes against which you can get a loan. Moreover, you will not be able to sell your mutual funds in case of underperformance, as the bank will hold a lien on it.",
        "Will I continue to receive dividends if I take a loan against mutual funds?": "You will continue to earn profits and receive dividends against your mutual funds even if you take a loan on them. The bank only holds a lien on them, which means that in case of default, the bank has the right to sell them. Until then, you can invest and receive dividends and interest on mutual funds."

The good news is that the city offers a variety of takeaway options through food-delivery apps.

But, if you prefer to buy only from big brands at malls, the cost will be much steeper.",
        "8.  Entertainment": "You may look forward to exploring Bangalore’s nightlife and fun attractions. Orion Mall and Mantri Mall are places where you will find all the entertainment you need—multiplexes restaurants, gaming zones, and other activities.

        "Why do people say credit cards are bad?": "Credit cards are not bad. However, this misconception is mainly due to the fees, charges, and interest rates on credit cards that arise from late payments or not paying the balance on time. Some cards have high processing fees, late fees, and penalties. On top of these fees, the interest charges on the unpaid balance are exorbitantly high. Hence most consider credit cards as bad. However, if you pay off your balance on time, you can avoid all these expenses and get rewards and cashback.",

Many payment apps and wallets are offering cashback on payments and money transfers. So you can get rewards without using a credit card."
